%%%%%%HOUSE FLORENT
%The Florents of Brightwater Keep are Tyrell bannermen; despite a superior claim to Highgarden by virtue of a blood tie to House Gardener; the old Kings of the Reach. At the outbreak of the War of the Five Kings; Lord Alester Florent followed the Tyrells in declaring for King Renly; but his brother Ser Axell chose King Stannis; whom he had served for years as castellan of Dragonstone. Their niece Selyse was and is King Stannis's queen. When Renly died at Storm's End; the Florents went over to Stannis with all their strength; the first of Renly's bannermen to do so. The sigil of House Florent shows a fox head in a circle of flowers.

%%%%%%HOUSE TYRELL
%The Tyrells rose to power as stewards to the Kings of the Reach; whose domain included the fertile plains of the southwest from the Dornish marches and Blackwater Rush to the shores of the Sunset Sea. Through the female line; they claim descent from Garth Greenhand; gardener king of the First Men; who wore a crown of vines and flowers and made the land bloom. When Mern IX; last king of House Gardener; was slain on the Field of Fire; his steward Harlen Tyrell surrendered Highgarden to Aegon the Conqueror. Aegon granted him the castle and dominion over the Reach. The Tyrell sigil is a golden rose on a grass-green field. Their words are Growing Strong.

%Lord Mace Tyrell declared his support for Renly Baratheon at the onset of the War of the Five Kings; and gave him the hand of his daughter Margaery. Upon Renly's death; Highgarden made alliance with House Lannister; and Margaery was betrothed to King Joffrey.

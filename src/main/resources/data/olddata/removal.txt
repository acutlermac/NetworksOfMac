Problems:

- Robert (FYI I still kept Sweetrobin in the input file)
- Jon (mostly should be Snow, but might also contain Jon Arryn)
- Jeyne Poole (not included in input since you commented this name out)
- Aegon (might contain both V and VI)
- Edd (nickname of Eddison Tollet, but also substring of Eddard)
- Arys (nickname of Arys Oakheart, substring of Varys)
- Irri (substring of Mirri)

The following were deleted by Jie's program:

- Arys (nickname of Arys Oakheart, substring of Varys)
- Irri (substring of Mirri)


Still to do:

- Jon (mostly should be Snow, but might also contain Jon Arryn)
- Jeyne Poole (not included in input since you commented this name out)
- Edd (nickname of Eddison Tollet, but also substring of Eddard)
